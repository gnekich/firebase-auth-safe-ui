# Firebase Authentication Safe UI

Google's Firebase Authentication UI has severe security issues, that can easily be fixed/mitigated. I've reported it to Google and my report got accepted but the issue is that the whole UI suffers from multiple issues based on the same technical issue. This repository is fixing the issue by providing publicly available Firebase Authentication UI that you can use instead of the default one provided by Google.

## As the fix for critical security issue is not yet publicly available and fixed I'm building this as mitigation option

## Future

This UI can be a community mantained alternative to the one provided by Google.
